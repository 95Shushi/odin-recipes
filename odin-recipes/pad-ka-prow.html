    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>This classic Thai dish of ground chicken and basil, with chili, fish sauce, and a touch of sugar, is quick and simple to prepare.</p>
    <p>Served over white rice with a runny fried egg, the dish is a dead ringer for the Sidewalk, lunch dish of choice—Adam has been known to order it four days in a row—at Serious Eats HQ. Office favorite Song Kran sells it for $8.95, but the home-cooked version will run you just about $3 a person.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>2 tablespoons vegetable oil</li>
        <li>Chiles, finely chopped (use 2-3 serrano peppers for very mild heat; 2-3 bird's eye chiles for medium heat)</li>
        <li>1 large shallot, finely sliced</li>
        <li>3 cloves garlic, minced</li>
        <li>1/3 pound green beans, trimmed, chopped in 1 1/4-inch lengths</li>
        <li>1/2 pound ground chicken</li>
        <li>2 tablespoons fish sauce</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons sugar</li>
        <li>1 bunch basil, leaves only</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>To serve:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Boiled rice</li>
        <li>Fried eggs, 1 per person (optional)</li>
        <li>Nam pla prik or fresh lime wedges</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat the oil over high heat in a wok or large frying pan. When you can see waves forming in the hot oil, add the chilis, shallots, and garlic and stir-fry until golden, about 30 seconds.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the green beans and stir-fry until cooked but still crunchy, 3 to 4 minutes.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the ground chicken, using a wooden spoon or spatula to break up the meat into small pieces. Stir-fry until chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Add the fish sauce and sugar to the pan, and stir to distribute. Taste, and add more fish sauce or sugar if desired.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Reduce heat to medium-low. Add the basil leaves and stir-fry until completely wilted. Remove from heat.</li>
        <br>
        <li>Serve with boiled rice, fried egg (optional), and nam pla prik or lime wedges.</li>
    </ol>
